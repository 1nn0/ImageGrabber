ImageGrabber is a Scrapy demo for grabbing images from other sites.

This is a simplified version of my original one, which is written
to scrape all images from a site (can't tell you which, sorry) for 
entertainment purpose. I removed the validation and database backend
support from the original one, and share this with others who look
for some examples to create their own spiders.

The URLs in the source is just a placeholder picked by random, so
don't expect it to scrape images from there.

And I am rather new to Python, so don't expect too high from me.
