ImageGrabber is a Scrapy demo for grabbing images from a website.

This is a simplified version of my original one, which is written
to download all images from a site for entertainment purpose. 

I removed the validation and database support from the origin, and share the rest with others who are looking
for some examples to create their own spiders.

The URLs in the source is just a placeholder picked by random, so
don't expect it to download images from there.

BTW, I am rather new to Python, so don't expect too high on me.
